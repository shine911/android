Welcome to AOSPA
===================


Getting Started
---------------

To get started with AOSPA, you'll need to get familiar with
[Git and Repo](http://source.android.com/download/using-repo).

Please take note that we have two main line branches depending on
which hardware base your phone is working.

for codina devices (included codinap):

	repo init -u git://github.com/shine911/android.git -b codina-aospa


Then sync up with this command:

	repo sync
