Welcome to Mokee
===================


Getting Started
---------------

To get started with Mokee, you'll need to get familiar with
[Git and Repo](http://source.android.com/download/using-repo).

Please take note that we have two main line branches depending on
which hardware base your phone is working.

for codina devices:

	repo init -u git://github.com/shine911/android.git -b kk_mkt


Then sync up with this command:

	repo sync
